## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I wanted to analze data from Airbnb from two different cities of Seattle and Boston:

1. How does price flucuate throughout the year?
2. What is the breakdown of the different property types available on Airbnb?
3. What factors effect the pricing on Airbnb?

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Kaggle, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  All three questions are evaluated in the notebook.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://marcnguyen0.wixsite.com/marcnguyen/post/booking-on-airbnb-through-the-eyes-of-a-data-scientist).
