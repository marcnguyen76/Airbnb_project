# Airbnb_project
<br>
In this project, I will be analyzing data from Airbnb for two different cities. The data is included in the project and are required for the code to run.
With the data, we are out to answer three questions:
Question 1: Does the season / month effect the price of listing? If so, which season / month is the most profitable? Which ones are least profitable? <br>
Question 2: What percentage of the different types of listing on AirBnB? Is there a property type that needs business focus? <br>
Question 3: What factors effects the price of the listing?
